# Data-science-use-case-to-solve-a-marketing-business-problem

## Different things tried to solve the problem at hand -
1. Built Random Forest models to get Top 10 variables
2. vif to address multicollinearity issue
3. Built Logistic Regression and XGBoost models as alternatives to Random Forest model
4. Performed oversampling using SMOTE technique
5. Compared the results before and after SMOTE and passed the important variables from Random Forest to a new Logistic Regression model in order to explain their impact on the output variable
